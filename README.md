# number8-js-test
JS test for Number8

This app generates a calendar spanning the necessary months to display the number of days specified by the user, starting with the date obtained from the user input. Displays Costa Rican and US holidays.


# Things to fix given more time:
Validate the country code field to allow only existing codes
Include holidays for more countries
Fix styles so that all days are the same size (some cells may end up narrower than others)
Trim out rows with no days in them


#Time from start to finish: Approximately 8.5 hours
